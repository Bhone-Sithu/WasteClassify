# Waste Classification AI model

My first AI project creating a model that classify wastes between Organic or Recycle.

This model is trained with thousands of waste images.

By utilizing Tensorflow, I created Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is a type of Deep Learning architecture.

This model has accuracy above 95% and its loss is only below 5%.
