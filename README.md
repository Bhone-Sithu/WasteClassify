# Waste Classification AI model

My first AI project creating a model that classify wastes between Organic or Recycle.

This model is trained with thousands of waste images.

By utilizing Tensorflow, I created Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is a type of Deep Learning architecture.

This model has accuracy above 95% and its loss is only below 5%.

This keras model has been converted to tensorflow json format to use it in React project.

To use this, you can visit this website :

And make sure you upload only the waste images and otherwise you will break the system xD 

Just kidding, there is no purpose in uploading other photo or file in a waste classification website right?
